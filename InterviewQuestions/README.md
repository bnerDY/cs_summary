###bloomberg:
1. Find the missing integer in an array of integers.  (sum minus)
2. Given an array of numbers, find the 2 two largest numbers in the array (hashmap)
3. How it's implemented a HashMap?  
4. The two-sum problem (hashmap)
5. Remove duplicates from an unsorted singly linked list.
6. Languages: Different between Java and C++, garbage collector in java (how it work), static vs dynamic memory allocation - Data structures: Linked lists, queues, stacks, heap, trees - OOP: polymorphism, design patterns that I used before - Algorithms: Sorting algorithms I know and there complexity, how to search for a number in an array (sorted and not sorted cases) - Coding question: reverse a singly linked list  
7. What is the role of the JVM ?  A Java virtual machine (JVM), an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine Specification, interprets compiled Java binary code (called bytecode) for a computer's processor (or "hardware platform") so that it can perform a Java program's instructions. Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform. A Java virtual machine makes this possible because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the platform.
8. What are the primitive data types in Java? What is the JVM and the Garbage Collector? Implement a method to decide whether a string is palindrome or not.  
	int, double, byte short, long, float, boolean, char.
9. What is Java Garbage Collection; Difference between an interface and an abstract class



###Microsoft:
1. Design an algorithm for parsing code to check whether all the brackets and parentheses match.
2. Given an array, find the value which is larger than all the values with smaller indexes, and smaller than all the values with larger indexes. (2-pass DP)
3. Describe recursion to a 5 year old child
4. reverse the order of words in a string.
5. Design a function to reverse a linked list.
6. 一面对基础知识进行考察，然后问算法写代码，一个是单链表删除倒数M个节点，一个是把二叉树保存到文件中，并从文件中读出并恢复二叉树。
二面问得比较水，求素数的算法，然后对可能出现的情况，进行了扩展。
三面是写个求两个字符串，最长公共子串的算法

4. http get/post difference
5. git workflow
6. git command
7. @property + key words. usage, difference
8. MVC -> MVVM
