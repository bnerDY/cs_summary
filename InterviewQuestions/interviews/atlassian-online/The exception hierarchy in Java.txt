The rationale behind the hierarchy is as follows:

Exception subclasses represent errors that a program can reasonably recover from. Except 
for RuntimeException and its subclasses (see below), they generally represent errors that 
a program will expect to occur in the normal course of duty: for example, network connection
errors and filing system errors.

Error subclasses represent "serious" errors that a program generally shouldn't expect to
catch and recover from. These include conditions such as an expected class file being missing, 
or an OutOfMemoryError.
RuntimeException is a further subclass of Exception. RuntimeException and its subclasses are 
slightly different: they represent exceptions that a program shouldn't generally expect to 
occur, but could potentially recover from. They represent what are likely to be programming 
errors rather than errors due to invalid user input or a badly configured environment.
